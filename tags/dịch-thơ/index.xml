      <description>Rain travel
Tác giả: William Stanley Merwin (Mỹ)
I wake in the dark and remember
it is the morning when I must start
by myself on the journey
I lie listening to the black hour
before dawn and you are
still asleep beside me while
around us the trees full of night lean
hushed in their dream that bears
us up asleep and awake then I hear
drops falling one by one into</description>

      <description>Apology (to the Muse)
Tác giả: Alan Dugan (Mỹ)
I&amp;rsquo;m so unaware of what
is going on around me that
I like to watch the brief lives
of the birds: they look around
before they take a seed because
they’re always there at present,
self-accounted for in their fears,
hungers and the necessaries
of their rites, whereas I
do not see approaching cars
forget dinner and my address
and realize your beauty</description>

      <description>I miss you daddy
Tác giả: Julia Michaels (Mỹ)
It’s been a year daddy
I really really miss you
Mommy says you’re safe now
In a beautiful place called heaven
We had your favorite dinner tonight
And I ate it all up&amp;hellip;
Even though I don’t like carrots
I learned how to swim this summer
And I can even open my eyes
When I’m under water
Can you see me?</description>

      <description>Yellow rain
Tác giả: Mai Der Vang (Mỹ)
First, the sting
in your nose.
Then in your eyes,
a furnace flared
To hollow
your face.
Flies above
your empty sockets.
Maggots made
your split skin.
Another cow dies
from breathing
as you swallowed
from the same air.
How many days before
it wintered you gray
in this wilderness turned
makeshift-graveyard.
How many hours
before the lesions,
before your vomit
hardens the earthen</description>

      <description>What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know before
Tác giả: Ada Limón (Mỹ)
was how horses simply give birth to other
horses. Not a baby by any means, not
a creature of liminal spaces, but already
a four-legged beast hellbent on walking,
scrambling after the mother. A horse gives way
to another horse and then suddenly there are
two horses, just like that. That’s how I loved you.

      <description>On a pink moon
Tác giả: Ada Limón (Mỹ)
I take out my anger
And lay its shadow
On the stone I rolled
Over what broke me.
I plant three seeds
As a spell. One
For what will grow
Like air around us,
One for what will
Nourish and feed,
One for what will
Cling and remind me&amp;ndash;
We are the weeds.
